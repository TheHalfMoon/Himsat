//! B506 active-vault deletion contract for Specification 004.
//!
//! This module owns only the bounded deletion coordinator required to retire one
//! active local vault. It defines which local surfaces must be removed, the exact
//! removal order, and the explicit retention/erasure limitations. It performs no
//! cryptographic operation, entropy acquisition, persistence implementation,
//! platform secure-store work, or network/provider deletion.
//!
//! The concrete backend owns every durable removal behind this boundary. The core
//! coordinator never assumes fixed filenames, database layouts, or platform
//! mechanics; each trait method documents the surface family it must cover,
//! including companion filesystem and database artifacts (`-wal`, `-shm`,
//! `-journal`, temp copies, staging directories).
//!
//! Removal order is intentionally crypto-shredding first: all active local
//! wrapped-key material is removed before ciphertext-bearing surfaces, with
//! freshness-anchor records removed before protector references so freshness
//! enumeration stays available through its own stage. An interruption after the
//! key-material stage therefore leaves remaining local ciphertext without its
//! Himsat-managed wraps, provided no key copies survive outside those wraps
//! (allocator, swap, dump, or flash-remnant copies remain a documented
//! limitation). This ordering does not claim physical-media erasure.
//!
//! Required caller flow before invoking the coordinator:
//!
//! 1. quiesce ordinary vault writes (the backend proves exclusion);
//! 2. tear down the live vault session through `VaultSessionLifetime::teardown`,
//!    which revokes the lease, closes keyed handles, releases VRK/KEK/purpose-key
//!    objects, zeroizes owned buffers, and discards session plaintext caches;
//! 3. invoke [`run_active_vault_deletion`] with the terminal lease.
//!
//! The terminal lease is revocation evidence, not teardown proof: it proves no
//! new keyed operation can be authorized and in-flight operations drained, but
//! it does not by itself prove handle closure, key release, or cache discard
//! ran. The caller must perform session teardown first; the coordinator refuses
//! a live lease before touching any durable surface, and every removal is
//! idempotent so a retried deletion after an interruption converges.
//!
//! Explicit non-goals, restated from the canonical Specification 004 deletion
//! limits and repeated in [`ACTIVE_VAULT_DELETION_LIMITATIONS`]:
//!
//! - detached/exported portable backups are independent copies and survive;
//! - provider snapshots, user-made duplicates, and external copies survive;
//! - no physical-media secure erasure is claimed (SSD/flash wear-levelling,
//!   controller remapping, and filesystem behavior may retain recoverable
//!   blocks);
//! - language/runtime zeroization does not erase allocator, swap, crash-dump, or
//!   kernel copies;
//! - provider-side deletion belongs to the connector/sync capability that
//!   controls that provider.
