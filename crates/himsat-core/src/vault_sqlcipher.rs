//! B301-B305 integration for the exact reviewed SQLCipher provider strategy.
//!
//! B301 opens the already provenance-registered SQLCipher build, applies the B201
//! `StructuredStore` purpose key as SQLCipher raw key material, verifies the exact
//! SQLCipher/embedded-SQLite runtime identities, and places the connection behind
//! the existing B105 lease gate. B302 additionally requires the keyed connection
//! to report encryption active before any handle can be returned. B303 pins the
//! reviewed OpenSSL provider/runtime identity, verifies the selected target-specific
//! SQLCipher temp-store compile posture, and disables file-backed temporary data.
//! B304 adds lease-gated normal SQLite integrity and SQLCipher cipher/page-
//! authentication integrity checks using the exact pinned provider semantics. B305
//! adds genuine wrong-key/corruption fixtures plus bounded mismatch tests for the
//! same production provider/version validators.
//!
//! B303 deliberately does not select one permanent journal mode. Qualification
//! exercises both WAL and rollback-journal operation because canonical contracts
//! require both families to work under the reviewed provider. Plaintext-spill
//! qualification and migration remain B306-B307.
